## **AI & Data Science Consultant | Former Cosmologist**

From exploring the vast mysteries of the universe during my PhD in Cosmology at the University of Cambridge, I’ve ventured into the complex world of AI and finance. My journey has taken me through postdoctoral research in **Machine Learning x Cosmology** (2020-2022), followed by consulting for a financial services firm in London, where I apply cutting-edge AI to transform business processes.

### **What I’m Up To**:
Currently, I’m wearing multiple hats—teaching AI, juggling a tech stack that sometimes feels as vast as the cosmos, and building something exciting (and a little chaotic) behind the scenes. My MVP is at the intersection of **finance, AI, and bleeding-edge technology**. It’s an adventure filled with highs, lows, and plenty of coffee!

### **Tech Struggles & Triumphs**:
I’ll admit, the road to building this product hasn’t been easy. From backend databases to AI models, wrangling the tech stack has been a challenge. But every struggle is an opportunity to grow—learning new frameworks, debugging issues, and constantly improving.

### **Connect with Me**:
Let’s chat about AI, cosmology, tech, or how to survive the startup grind. I’m always open to discussions and collaborations.
