From exploring the vast mysteries of the universe during my PhD in Cosmology at the University of Cambridge, Iâ€™ve ventured into the complex world of AI and finance. My journey has taken me through postdoctoral research in **Machine Learning x Cosmology** (2020-2022), followed by consulting for a financial services firm in London, where I apply cutting-edge AI to transform business processes.
